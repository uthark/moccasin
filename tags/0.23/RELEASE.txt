Moccasin 0.21 Release Notes

- Add Moccasin capability for both Flex component-based and Flash
  Sprite-based view hierarchies, by abstracting IMoccasinView interface
  and offering multiple view superclasses extending Canvas and
  UIComponent.

- Added a rollover state to handles

- Accounted for possibility of null value models in a MoccasinModel,
  and for potential changes to Moccasin value properties

- Added getValueModel() function to MoccasinModel to obtain named
  value model properties

- Add value model property change listeners

- Fix bug in initialization order for MoccasinCanvas, in which
  updateView() was being called before a subclass constructor could
  fully initialize the state of the object.

- Added MoccasinModelFactory extension point for model-wrapping
  behavior, so that additional "smarts" can be added in a
  MoccasinModel subclass if desired.

- Added SelectEvent for easier application handling of selection
  changes.
